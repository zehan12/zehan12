<h3 align="center">A passionate Full Stack Developer from India</h3>
<p align="center">As a crazy full stack developer, I am driven by a desire to explore and learn every tech stack that I can get my hands on. I am not satisfied with just sticking to one set of technologies, but rather I crave the opportunity to expand my skills and knowledge in a wide range of areas. Whether it be front-end, back-end, or even emerging technologies, I am always eager to dive in and see what I can learn and accomplish.
